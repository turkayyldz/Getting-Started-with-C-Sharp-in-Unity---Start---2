Author:				Paolo Veronese

Description:			The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), by Paolo Veronese (1528–1588), is a representational painting that depicts the biblical story of the Marriage at Cana, at which Jesus converts water to 				wine. Executed in the Mannerist style of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77m × 9.94m) oil painting comprehends the stylistic ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by 				the artists Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo.
